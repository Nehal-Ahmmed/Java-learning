WRAPPER CLASSES: A class whose object contains or wraps PDT (premitive data type: int float double char etc).
    Object of a wrapper class contains a field which stores PDT.

 How to declare: A wrapper class is already created in java.lang
 where various attributes has already created by java authority.
 So to make an object of the wrapper class user had to follow the
 rules of declaring an object of a created class.
 Such as: Integer n=new Integer(value: 3);

 but it is not valid at present.

 So the latest process is :

   Integer n=Integer.valueof(4);
   Float f=Float.valueof(3.5);

   In such a way:
   int -> Integer
   float->Float
   double-> Double
   boolean-> Boolean
   char -> Character
   long-> Long

 Why to declare: Java is an object oriented programming language.
 So , permitive data types actually violent java & sometimes create problem.
 In order to solve the issue , wrapper classes is used .Thus permitive data types
 is stored in a class and converted in object.
