-> User often faces different problems in 1D and 2D array as they are not changeable.
User cannot edit the created array as his own will as the size of an array is always fixed.
In order to deal the issue , arraylist is created.
-> ADVANTAGES:
    1. Changeable & undefined array size.
    2. add a new element arbitrarily(icchamoto).
    3. arbitrarily print any element of the array.
    4. convert the array to an object automatically.



-> Basic syntax:
    ArrayList<Integer> name = new Arraylist<>(); //wrapper class must be used. premitive datatype is not allowed.
   ( List<AnyClass>list= new Arraylist<AnyClass>();)

-> how to create: in the next class.
